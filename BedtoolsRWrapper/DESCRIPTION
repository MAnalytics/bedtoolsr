Description: The purpose of my project is to write an R package that allows seamless use of bedtools from within the R environment. To accomplish this, I will write a python script that reads in the bedtools code and writes the entire R package.  By generating the code in this fashion, we can ensure that our package can easily be generated for all current and future versions of bedtools.
