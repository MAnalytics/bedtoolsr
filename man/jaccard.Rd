\title{Calculate Jaccard statistic b/w two feature files.
Jaccard is the length of the intersection over the union.
Values range from 0 (no intersection) to 1 (self intersection).}
\usage{
jaccard(a, b, e = NULL, g = NULL, F = NULL, f = NULL, S = NULL,
  bed = NULL, header = NULL, s = NULL, r = NULL, split = NULL,
  nonamecheck = NULL, iobuf = NULL, nobuf = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{b}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{e}{Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
  that either 90 percent of A is covered OR 10 percent of  B is covered.
  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.}

\item{g}{Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.}

\item{F}{Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)}

\item{f}{Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)}

\item{S}{Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{bed}{If using BAM input, write output as BED.}

\item{header}{Print the header from the A file prior to results.}

\item{s}{Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{r}{Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
  that B overlap 90 percent of A and A _also_ overlaps 90 percent of B.}

\item{split}{Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.}

\item{nonamecheck}{For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".}

\item{iobuf}{Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.}

\item{nobuf}{Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
other software tools and scripts that need to process one
line of bedtools output at a time.}
