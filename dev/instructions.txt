Example command: intersect("A.bed", "B.bed")


If an option has a numeric or string value, assign it one using the equals operator. For example: "f = 1". If an option has no value, assign it the value "TRUE" in all caps. For example: "c = TRUE".

If an option with a numeric value has multiple numbers, attach as a string. Example: bedtools map a.bed b.bed c = "3,4,5,6".
